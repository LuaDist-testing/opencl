[OpenCL for Lua] provides bindings for the Open Compute Language ([OpenCL]),
an open standard for cross-platform, parallel programming of GPUs, CPUs, and
other processors. [LuaJIT] is a just-in-time compiler for the [Lua] language
that provides native C data structures through its foreign function interface
([FFI]) library. OpenCL for Lua supports up to [OpenCL 1.2] using LuaJIT.
